What is git ?

// Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously. It tracks changes in source code during software development, enabling collaboration and version management. Git stores the history of changes, allowing users to revert to previous versions, branch out for new features, and merge changes from different contributors efficiently.
